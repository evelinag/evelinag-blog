Welcome to my blog!

I'm writing about data science, machine learning and software development.

I'm **Dr Evelina Gabašová**, a data scientist and machine learning researcher, working in The Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national centre for data science and artificial intelligence. I'm also Microsoft F# MVP and an international speaker.
